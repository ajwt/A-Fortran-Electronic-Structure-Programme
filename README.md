# A Fortran Electronic Structure Programme (AFESP)
This project is based on the Crawford Group's excellent [C++ Programming Tutorial in Chemistry](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects), but written in Fortran. 
The end goal of this project will be performing HF, MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T), as per the original tutorial, but with additional support for multicore processors (modern CPUs, GPUs).
