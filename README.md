# A Fortran Electronic Structure Programme (AFESP)
This project is based on the Crawford Group's excellent [C++ Programming Tutorial in Chemistry](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects), but written in Fortran. 
The end goal of this project will be performing HF, MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T), as per the original tutorial, but with additional support for multicore processors (modern CPUs, GPUs).

## Progress
~~1. Geometry read-in~~
~~2. Integral read-in~~
~~3. Nuclear repulsion energy calculation~~
~~4. Hartree-Fock without symmetry~~
~~5. Pretty printing, time reporting~~
~~6. MP2 without symmetry~~
7. CCSD without symmetry
8. Adapting Hartree-Fock with symmetry
9. Ditto for MP2
10. Ditto for CCSD
11. CCSD(T) with symmetry
12. OpenMP / MPI parallelisation
13. GPU adaptation for MP2 and CCSD/(T)
