# A Fortran Electronic Structure Programme (AFESP)
This project is based on Crawford Group's excellent [C++ Programming Tutorial in Chemistry](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects), but written in Fortran. 
The end goal of this project will be performing HF, MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) with support for multicore processors (modern CPUs, GPUs).
